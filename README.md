# EcoXcess
EcoXcess is a hackathon project my teammates and I made for BuildingBlocs hackathon in 2024 over 2 days after 3 days of learning about basic data science.
# What is EcoXcess
EcoXcess is a program that aims to promote sustainable living by offering personalized suggestions, calculating carbon footprints, and providing eco-friendly tips. It makes use of AI technology to generating suggestions and integrates data representation to help users reduce their environmental impact.
# What have we used to make this program?
- Google Generative AI: For generating personalized suggestions and eco-friendly tips.
- Pandas: For handling and processing data.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
- CSV: For storing user data.
# Future plans
- To create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a more user friendly experience
- Add on extended Data Analysis to incorporate advanced data analysis and predictive modeling to offer more personalized recommendations.
